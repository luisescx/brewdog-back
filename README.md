# Authentication API

- The API does a CRUD of users.
- Authenticated routes.

## Technologies

- NodeJs
- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- Postgres
- Docker
- Bcryptjs
- Jsonwebtoken

### Remarks:

- The project uses `Docker` to execute the application and the database in a container, you must have docker installed in your machine.
- The `postgres` in the container runs in the `5432` port, the same port from the default `postgres`, if you are running postgres locally, stop the postgres service. 

### How to run:

- Clone the project and execute `yarn` in the root folder.
- Execute `docker compose up`.
- Run the migrations to update the database with `yarn migration:run`.
